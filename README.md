This project explores sales data from a fictional retail business, "Superstore," using Tableau/Power BI to uncover actionable business insights. The goal is to apply data visualization and storytelling techniques to analyze sales trends, identify high-performing categories, and highlight underperforming regions.

Key questions addressed:

Which product categories generate the most profit?

How do different regions and customer segments perform?

Are there noticeable seasonal or time-based sales trends?

By creating clear and interactive visualizations, the project demonstrates how data can guide strategic decisions and improve business outcomes.
